Game Ideas

- Lupin III RL
    - potentially episodic
    - stealth game
    - fits in well w/ traditional maguffin-fetch RL
    - potential AI
    - hidden "audacity meter" that literally gives plot armor + extra speed when doing crazy stunts, especially on escape
        - tied in to "momemuntum"
    - different scenerios
        - different "friends" w/ different motivations: jigen, goemon, fujiko, zenigata
    - some kind of mystery to solve at the same time
    -
    
- DotA RL
    - multiplayer
    - victory through ganks (multiplayer combos)
    - LOS will be a big deal
    
- Earthbound RL

- Western RL
    - narrative tension / plotarmor at critical junctures, e.g. shootouts etc
